# miniRPG 2 - Version 2.0 of a 2D sidescroller mini RPG game
# By Jason McCoy
*So far only compatible with iPhone 6S for iOS 10.

The point of the game is to simply press the attack button to kill the opponent to the left/right as you choose.

This is a two player game, so each character should have an attack button and when one player attacks, the other player/button is disabled for 3 seconds before they can attack. If a player dies, the screen should print who won and when the game ends, an option to restart the game will be available.


Lets see what the app looks like in the beginning...
